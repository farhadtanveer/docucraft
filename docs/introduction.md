# Introduction

Welcome to the **Project Documentation Platform** — a documentation website built with **Next.js** to help teams create, organize, and maintain technical project documentation in a clean, scalable, and developer-friendly way.

This project is designed for real product teams who need:

- structured technical docs
- fast navigation
- version-friendly content
- and a simple workflow for writing and maintaining documentation

The main goal is to treat documentation as a **first-class part of the project**, not an afterthought.

## Why this project exists

In real projects, documentation is usually scattered across:

- Notion pages
- Google Docs
- internal chats
- and outdated README files

This makes it hard to:

- onboard new developers
- track architecture decisions
- keep API references updated
- and maintain long-term product knowledge

This project solves that by providing a centralized, web-based documentation system built with modern frontend tooling.

## What this documentation platform provides

This documentation project focuses on:

- Markdown-based content (`.md` / `.mdx`)
- structured navigation (sidebar + sections)
- version-controlled documentation (Git friendly)
- fast search and routing
- clean and minimal UI for reading and writing

The platform is suitable for:

- internal company documentation
- API documentation
- architecture guides
- onboarding manuals
- operational and deployment guides

---

## Technology stack

The documentation system is built with:

- **Next.js** as the application framework
- Markdown / MDX for content
- modern React-based layout and routing
- static generation for fast loading and SEO

The project follows a simple principle:

> Documentation should be easy to write, easy to review, and easy to publish.

## How this documentation is structured

Each documentation page is written as a Markdown file and organized by topic.

A typical structure looks like this:
